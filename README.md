# Using Markov chains to solve PDEs

In this paper, we discuss a probabilistic method relying on Markov chains to solve partial differential equations (PDEs)
of the form $\Delta f âˆ’\gamma f = 0$ with Dirichlet conditions. We will implement our solution in two dimensions on the
unit square domain with basic 0/1 boundary conditions. Nonetheless the method presented can be generalized in arbitrary dimension,
with much more complex domains and boundary conditions.
